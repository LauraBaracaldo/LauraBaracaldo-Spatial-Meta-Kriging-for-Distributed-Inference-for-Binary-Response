# LauraBaracaldo-Spatial-Meta-Kriging-for-Distributed-Inference-for-Binary-Response

This work extends the earlier work on spatial meta kriging for the analysis of
large multivariate binary spatial data. Spatial meta kriging presents a three-step
distributed framework wherein the analyst first partitions the data into subsets, analyzes
each subset using a Bayesian spatial process model and obtains approximate posterior 
inference for the entire dataset by combining posterior distributions from subsets.
